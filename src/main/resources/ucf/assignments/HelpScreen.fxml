To start this application, input the desired name of the list you want to create and press enter.&#10;3. To add a task, input the necessary information on the bottom of the page and press the Add button.&#10;4. To delete a task, press on the task that you wish to delete and press the delete button on the bottom of the page.&#10;5.*** To edit a task, click on the corresponding column and change it with whatever VALID value you would to change it to.&#10;For each column, put in a filler value to change so it registers that you are changing a value in one of the columns.&#10;Once you do that, then you can edit any values you wish.&#10;5. To clear all items, press on clear all items and the all items in the list will be deleted.&#10;6. To export your list to a txt file, press the ' export list ' button on the top right of the page, which will take you to a file directory. Write the name of your file and save&#10;it in your desired area.&#10;7. To import a list, click on ' Import Existing List ' and click on the list that you want to open and press open. &#10;8. To Sort a list by the Description, Due Date, and whether the task is completed or not,&#10;  click on the corresponding column and the table will sort the data based on which column and order you select&#10;&#10;*** PLEASE INSERT A RANDOM VALUE THE FIRST TIME YOU WANT TO EDIT IN ANY COLUMN.&#10;IT WILL KEEP THE SAME VALUE BUT ONCE YOU EDIT EVERY OTHER TIME, IT WILL EDIT CORRECTLY!!&#10;THANKS!!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;I dedicate this page to REY for being an amazing and thoughtful person to go out of his way to make sure that we need to include a help manual!!!!&#10;" />
